# Experiments

This folder contains parameters generated for the first through sixth ASPCOMP.
- `generateStatistics.py` is a script to generate the parameters of ASP programs.
- `Parameters.csv` contains the generated parameters
- `Results.Rmd` is a R script to generate correlations between parameters
    - `Results.html` contains the output of the `Results.Rmd` script
- `Summary.Rmd` is a R script to generate correlations between parameters
    - `Summary.html` contains the output of the `Summary.Rmd` script

## Execution
- place htd_main, exst, clasp and gringo in the Experiments directory
- add the non-ground programs in the Experiments directory
- run the generateStatistics.py script
    - the log files and the remaining folders are generated by the script

## What the script does
1. The script grounds the programs
2. The script executes clasp to get the time and clasp parameters
3. The script executes exst to generate the extended parameters
4. The script generates the tree-width with htd
5. The script combines the parameters into the Parameters.csv file

## File structure
- Folders:
  - Programs                        - directory for the non-ground programs
    - Year                          - one directory for each year of the competition
      - Problem                     - one directory for each problem containing a `encoding.asp` file with the encoding and the data files
  - Ground                          - directory for the ground programs
  - Graphs                          - directory containing the graphs
  - Times                           - directory for the clasp output
  - ExParamters                     - directory for the exst output
- Files:
  - Ground_Oversize.log             - log for files which are too big after grounding
  - Ground_Timeout.log              - log for files which took too long for grounding
  - Ground_Error.log                - log for files where an error occurred during grounding
  - Times_Failed.log                - log for files where the clasp parameter generation failed
  - Extended_Stats_Failed.log       - log for files where the extended parameter calculation failed
  - Parameters.csv                  - final file containing the parameters
  - tmp.txt                         - temporary file used for width generation
- Programs:
  - gringo                          - gringo to ground the programs
  - clasp                           - clasp to get the time and the parameters
  - htd_main                        - htd for generating the tree-width
  - exst                            - the clasp extension to generate the extended parameters
